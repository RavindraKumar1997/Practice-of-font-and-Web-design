                <p>
                    <b>Albert Einstein</b> was a German-born theoretical physicst who is widely held to be one of the greatest and most influential scientists of all time. Best known for developing the theory of relativity,Einstein also made important contributions to quantum mechanics, and was thus a central figure in the revolutionary reshaping of the scientific understanding reshaping of the scientific understanding of nature that modern physics accomplished in the first decades of the twentieth century. His mass-energy equivalence formula, which arises from relativity theory, has been called "the world's most famous equation".
